## Open License Cheer Scoring System

The purpose of this is to create a system of scoring in cheer that does not directly dictate how a team must create a routine to score well. Instead teams can create completely different verisons of routines to score well, and anyone (judges/coaches/athletes/parents) have a consistent and reliable way to score where everyone can converge on the same score. One of the major challenges of cheerleading is that parts of our sport are very subjective (the movement, the choreography, the dance) and the other part is very (in every athlete and coaches eyes) objective (though no one has classified how to make it objective). 

To address this, while keeping the parts of the score sheet that are working well in cheer, I have created a way to classify difficulty in skills and count them based off division size. Every coach, athlete, and parent could learn the rules and apply the principles below to figure out the difficulty score of a performance. 

Point values are to be determined and can be adjusted as we learn how the system works. The key is the system is flexible to adjust (even as the year goes on). It is also not dependent on one set of level rules or a set level rules from a certain year. Nothing is explicitly defined, so this system can grow and change as things go on. *Note the examples are based off USASF rules as they are the most commonly known, but not required. 

### Classification of Skills

Skills are classified in each level based off of what is newly allowed in the level. Difficulty scoring is only earned by doing skills that are allowed in the existing level, but not in the previous level. For level 1 any skill newly classifed as a certain element beings the classification of skills. 

#### Elemental Skills

Any skill that was allowed in a previous level is considered an elemental skill, and not used for any difficulty scoring. These skills would be used for transitional or choreographical purposes. There is no penalty for performing elemental skills. **EXAMPLE** A forward roll in Level 2 would be consdered an elemental skill.

#### Iterations

One of the core concepts of this scoring system is something inherrently happening in cheerleading anyway, and that is iterations. Every skill has an interation to it that makes it more difficult. These iterations involve chaining together multiple skills to create combos, or performing a skill to a more difficult level. These benchmarks happen based off the legality of what is performed in level. Once we talk about examples, this will make more sense. 

Iterations are:
* Multiple newly available skills performed together without stopping 
* Non-repetive elemental skills added to newly availabe skills (must be a skill that is scorable in a previous level)
* Building skills performed / caught at a higher level of extension, to a body position, or using less bases (the start of all base scoring is done with 3. using 2 bases is one letter up, using 1 base is 2 letters up. If a skill is attempted as a 1 base but is assisted as 2, that drops a letter grade)
* Adding at least one full rotation to move up a letter
* Every legal level of stunt from smoosh, to half, to extended is a letter up.

This leads us to the letter classification of skills

#### A Skills

Any skill that is newly allowed in a level that was not allowed in the previous level, and is done to the bare minimum. *Example - A full up to smoosh in Level 3. Two standing backhandsprings in level 3. 

#### B Skills

Any skill that is performed one iteration above an A skill. Skills performed in combination can be used to iterate to the next level. What determines if a skill is a combination is if the movement of one skill does not stop and is used to flow to the next skill. This will never take longer than 2 counts to transition at most.  *Example - A full up to half in level 3. 3 standing handsprings in level 3

#### C-Z Skills

For every subsequent letter each skill is one iteration above the previous level. There is no limit to iterations. 

### Skill Categories

The six skill categories that make up a cheer routine. 

* Standing Tumbling
* Running Tumbling
* Jumps
* Baskets
* Stunts
* Pyramid

#### Examples of classifying skills. 



### Skill Divisors Based Off Division Size

For each division size there is a threshold of skills to be performed to get scored at a certain level. This takes into account the team aspect of cheer and that skills. To get a 

While these divisors can adjust as needed as division sizes change, the starting values based off USASF divisions are:

XS - 3
Small - 4
International 24 - 5
Medium - 6
Large - 7

Based off skill categories we multiple or divide the divisor based off the nature of the skill. For tumbling / jumps, we multiple the divisor by 3 to meet the divisor threshold. For baskets and stunts we keep the divisor as is. For pyramid we divide the number by 2 (and round to the next whole). 

### Counting Skills For Skill Difficulty Scoring

Each performed skill for a classification is counted towards a total for a category. This means skills can be done in the routine at any time with any lettered skill level and be counted towards the total. You are not penalized for doing skills in any particular order by lack of difficulty or grouping them together. 

### Awarding Points For Skills Performed

Once all the skills for each skill category are counted and listed, we can now award points. We need enough counted skills to meet our divisor threshold. Your highest rated skills (as long as they meet the divisor threshold) are counted first. Your points are awarded from that first threshold, and always the highest first. If you do not have enough counted skills at the highest level to meet a threshold, the remaining skills are dropped down and grouped in the next skill category. Accumulating until we have enough to meet the divisor threshold. This allows scoring to have no hard cap. The order of the skills performed in the routine does not effect scoring. You could performed your hardest skills last, and as those skills are your hardest they will get the points awards to you first. 

For each skill category, the first time you do something you will get awards 1.5 points. That will count down by .1 each subsequent time you do a scorable skill in the category until you reach .1 (on the 15th countable skill). At that point all skills from that moment on are worth .1. 

Every letter above an A adds .1 to the skill section. If you perform enough B skills to meet your divisor in stunts and that is your hardest stunt, you will get a 1.6 for your first iteration. If you perform a G skill for your first divisor, you will get 2.1 for your first divisor. 


### Point Decay

Every time you meet the divisor threshold for a skill, you are awarded points. The next time you are awarded points the amount has decreased for the skill category by .1. Once you reach .1 as the highest amount for your base A skill, all subsequent skills are rated .1 from there on (plus whatever letter skill upgrades there are). 

### Points Examples

For the purposes of simplicity and our western bias to base 10 numbers, the skill category scoring will trend towards an asymptope of 15 (adding up to 90, and leaving 10 points availabe for the listed below). 

We can use averages to figure out the average amount of skills performed per category, and use that to create our A level scoring. Each subsequent iteration can raise the value by .1. And then each subsequent scoring divisor can drop the amount available. 

### Execution Scoring

Every routine will have execution scoring on the skills provided. This is done on the 6 skill categories. Execution scoring is deductive, and performed on the skills presented. If a skill is not performed (someone didn't go in tumbling or a stunt did not attempt to go up) it is not judged. The deductions come off the earned difficulty score. Falls or incompleted skills are never counted to your divisor, but also are subject to lowering execution. 

### Performance Scoring

There is 10 points to be divided up to the judges for more subjective levels of of our sport: Dance, formations, creativity, and Overall Impression. (each with a 2.5 available points). 

### Judges Required And How To Score

All scoring panels will be made up of 5 people. 3 judges will be live scoring execution, 1 judge will be doing level judging (safety judging), 1 judge will be doing difficulty assessment. 

#### Live Scoring Execution Judges

This group of judges works pretty much exactly as scoring works now, but is a lot simpler by design so that the judges can watch and enjoy the routines. These judges only assess the quality and performance of the skills being executed, not the difficulty. This allows them the ability to reward creativity in skills without having to worry how hard something is. This is also the element that cannot be scored well over video.

#### Level Judge

Because of the nature of how we are scoring difficulty, all coaches will now have a more intimate relationship with the levels and what is legal in each. As well, it is in the coaches best interest to try and come up with skills that are several iterations away from the A skills. This will mean people will (on purpose or by accident) perform skills that are not level appropriate. The infractions are:

* Non-choreographed performance error out of level skill performed - each individual instance is not counted for the purposes of difficulty
* Choregraphed out of level skill - each individual instance removes one tally used for scoring

### Skill Assessor

The skill assessor's job is to look at what skill is performed, classify that skill (elemental, A, B... etc), and then count that skill to the tally. This job does not have to be performed live (and would probably incorrectly be able to do it live as there are a lot of moving parts). This job will take a video to review. In testing a Skill Assessor can assess a routine in about 4 minutes watching a video. As they are not live they do not have to be waited on for the next team to go. The live portion of scoring is compelted. This could even be done remotely if the IT infrastruture was mature. 

### Video Review Of Difficulty / Level Skills And Performance Totem

As the skill assessor will be reviewing a lot of skills there will be chances for mistakes. This is easily correctable with a video review. All video reviews of classifiable skills require a challenge fee from the coach. If the second assessment is determined to make a score changing improvement, the assessment fee is refunded. If not, the challenge fee is kept and then donated to local charity (this is not a money making venture). 

Not all competitions have a live video review service or streaming, so the ability for challenge might be harder. This task can be put upon the coaches and parents to provide a quality video for review. This video is provided and the skill assessor can do their job. Note all skills must be visible to the camera to correctly assess (if something happens off screen, it is not assessed). Multiple videos of the routine cannot be used to create one assessed video. 

Security Toten - every single day a competition is held there will be one unique security totem put on the stage that the EP is responsible for. This totem can be anything that is easily recognizable on video that it is there. Think a stuffed pink bunny, or a potted plant. It literally can be anything and it can only be used once. This totem would be visable in the video and confirm to the skill assessment reviewer that the video provided was taken from that day. The video provided must be of the complete routine and all skills assessed can only be done from what is on the field of view (if a skill happened out of the field of view it is assumed it did not happen and cannot be counted, multiple videos at one time cannot be used to assess a routine. Only one video). 

### Benefits

The benefits of this sytem are as follows:
* Repeatable difficulty scoring - The same difficulty score can consistently be calculated by multiple people
* Routines can now look multiple different ways
* Faster competitions and scoring - As review is only for difficulty and happens separate this should not slow downt he release of scores. As well because scores are not comparative, this does not slow down entire divisions
* Routine limits are removed - we have not capped where routines can go, so they can explore the space and find new ways to win and perform
* Cost effective judging panel (would require less judges than as needed today)

### Challenges

Currently there are some very odd things allowed in levels that would need to be addressed (but could be done rather easily if there was energy to get it done). 

* The building skills between level 5 and 6 would need more defined seperation
* Some building skills need to be adjusted by definition for being allowed for group but not coed (BHS up to extended in level 4 for example). This can be done by increasing the number of people required to be invovled for the skill
