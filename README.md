## Open License Cheer Scoring System

The purpose of this is to create a system of scoring in cheer that does not directly dictate how a team must create a routine to score well. Instead teams can create completely different verisons of routines to score well, and judges have a way to reliably score them. One of the major challenges of cheerleading is that parts of our sport are very subjective (the movement, the choreography, the dance) and the other part is very (in every athlete and coaches eyes) objective (though no one has classified how to make it objective). 





### Classification of Skills

Skills are classified in each level based off of what is newly allowed in the level. Difficulty scoring is only earned by doing skills that are allowd in the existing level, but not in the previous level 

### Skill Divisors Based Off Division Size

### Point Decay

### Counting Skills For Skill Difficulty Scoring

### Execution Scoring

### Performance Scoring

### Judges Required And How To Score

All scoring panels will be made up of 5 people. 3 judges will be live scoring execution, 1 judge will be doing level judging (safety judging), 1 judge will be doing difficulty assessment. 

#### Live Scoring Execution Judges

This group of judges works pretty much exactly as scoring works now, but is a lot simpler by design so that the judges can watch and enjoy the routines. These judges only assess the quality and performance of the skills being executed, not the difficulty. This allows them the ability to reward creativity in skills without having to worry how hard something is. This is also the element that cannot be scored well over video.

#### Level Judge

Because of the nature of how we are scoring difficulty, all coaches will now have a more intimate relationship with the levels and what is legal in each. As well, it is in the coaches best interest to try and come up with skills that are several iterations away from the A skills. This will mean people will (on purpose or by accident) perform skills that are not level appropriate. The infractions are:

Non-choreographed performance error out of level skill performed - each individual instance is not counted for the purposes of difficulty
Choregraphed out of level skill - each individual instance removes one tally used for scoring
