## Open License Cheer Scoring System

The purpose of this is to create a system of scoring in cheer that does not directly dictate how a team must create a routine to score well. Instead teams can create completely different verisons of routines to score well, and judges have a way to reliably score them. One of the major challenges of cheerleading is that parts of our sport are very subjective (the movement, the choreography, the dance) and the other part is very (in every athlete and coaches eyes) objective (though no one has classified how to make it objective). 





### Classification of Skills

Skills are classified in each level based off of what is newly allowed in the level. Difficulty scoring is only earned by doing skills that are allowd in the existing level, but not in the previous level
